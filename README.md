**FitTag** is a watchOS and iOS app designed to collect and label motion sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) during physical activities. The recorded data is intended for training machine learning models to recognize activity patterns such as walking, running, cycling, or swimming.

## üì± Features

- Record raw accelerometer and gyroscope data from Apple Watch or iPhone
- Manually tag the activity being performed (e.g., walking, running)
- Save sessions to Firebase Firestore
- View a list of past recordings, including duration and activity type
- Designed with SwiftUI and supports both watchOS and iOS platforms

## üîç Use Case

FitTag is especially useful for developers and researchers working on activity recognition, fitness tracking, or machine learning models that need labeled motion data from real users.

## üß† Tech Stack

- Swift & SwiftUI
- watchOS & iOS
- CoreMotion
- Firebase Firestore

## üöß Status

FitTag is currently under development. More features and improvements will be added soon, including:
- CSV export of recorded data
- Data visualization
- Model integration for real-time activity recognition

## üìÇ Project Structure (WIP)
